<h1>The Best Movies According to Keely</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Little Shop of Horrors</h3>
<p>There are very few musicals that stand out to me and make a likes, let alone favorites list. This is a classic!</p>
<h3>New York, I love You</h3>
<p>Any movie that chronicles a complex metropolitan city like New York wins me over. I like this movie and its display of dynamic, intertwined characters</p>
<h3>Life Itself</h3>
<p>Heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time.</p>
